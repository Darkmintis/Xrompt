## 🎨 Style Guidelines

### JavaScript

- Use vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
- Use modern ES6+ syntax
- Add comments for complex logic
- Follow existing code structure
- Use meaningful variable names

```javascript
// Good
const userInputTask = document.getElementById('task').value;

// Avoid
const x = document.getElementById('task').value;
```

### CSS

- Use CSS custom properties (variables) defined in `:root`
- Follow BEM-like naming for classes
- Keep selectors simple and efficient
- Add comments for sections

```css
/* Good */
.form-group { }
.form-group__label { }

/* Avoid */
div.container > form > div.group { }
```

### HTML

- Use semantic HTML5 elements
- Keep accessibility in mind (ARIA labels, alt text)
- Maintain clean indentation
- Add comments for major sections

```html
<!-- Good -->
<section id="survey-section" aria-label="Survey Form">
  <h2>Create Your Prompt</h2>
</section>

<!-- Avoid -->
<div id="survey">
  <div class="title">Create Your Prompt</div>
</div>
```
